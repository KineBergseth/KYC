error management
data validation - let user know if input is wrong/person is ok, person dont exists, org no. wrong etc
get request 4 search is too slow, do better
fix config file
split routes into routing + controller?

SEARCH:
show roles when searching company + append person pep score
more company data

QUEUE:
make button update db with note
if waiting further analysis - bullet thingy with text
only get waiting / further analysis on list
confirm window, refresh after pressing button
refresh listgroup

SUMMARY:
datatable instead of table?
embed graphs instead with js sdk, iframe is ugh
fancy red/green/yellow dot for status?
make sure graphs gets data from right collection hehe

Lastly: CSS to make it pretty/responsive
- change bootstrap theme, i dont like the current that much
